This is a general set of instructions to be followed while evaluating the programs.
1) Do not displace any file from the folder as some files are meant to be in the same directory to work 
2) You can change the process/equation parameters accordingly as in the sections that are defined as "Defining Constants"
3) I have attached a folder named 'html' which contains the html version of the program outputs which can be used to view the output or to view the code
4) Do not remove any PNG files from the 'html' folder as they are supposed to be in the same directory to be published in the html
5) I have not suppressed the Warning Messages in some codes, they will also appear in the output, you may ignore them
