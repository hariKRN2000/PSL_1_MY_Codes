# PSL_1_MY_Codes
Some of the codes that I wrote for the Process Simulation Lab. These codes are very useful to students who are just introduced to using Computer methods to solve problems in Chemical Engineering <br> 
## These codes are answers to some questions found in the PDF. I have also mentioned a User Manual so as to how to use these codes. The HTML files are fun to use and I have made them interactive with hyperlinks.
